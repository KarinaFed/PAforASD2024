# K-Means Clustering with Parallel Processing
## Algorithm and Parallelization Method
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm using both sequential and parallel approaches. The sequential version is implemented in `kmeans_sequential.py`, while the parallel version utilizes Dask for distributed computing in `kmeans_parallel.py`.
